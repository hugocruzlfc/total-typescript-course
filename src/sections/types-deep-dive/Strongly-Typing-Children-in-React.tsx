// Strongly Typing Children Isn't Possible
// Unfortunately, strongly typing children in React is not possible right now, as they are inferred as JSX.Element.

// This means we can't get any more information about the thing that we're rendering on the type level without a change inside of React or TypeScript themselves.

// While it isn't possible, it's not really that big of an issue. In a way, strongly typing children in React ruins the compositional model. You should be able to pass anything to anything and have React figure it out.

// Unless React and TypeScript make changes to make this possible, we'll have to live with this limitation.
